## Power Bi project analyzing a ten-year dataset (2011-2021) on national gas and electricity consumption in France, with the objective of understanding energy consumption trends and working towards energy-saving goals.

## *A Power-Bi project that aims to analyze national gas and electricity consumption in France over a ten-year period (2011-2021) in order to understand the main sources of energy consumption and work towards energy-saving goals. The dataset used for the project was obtained from the French government's Open Data website and includes information such as the year, energy type, consumption category, consumer category, sector, business identification, energy consumed, delivery point, and consumption regions. The dataset does not cover all energy commodities and does not include data for the year 2022 due to the Russo-Ukrainian War. The data was processed using Microsoft Excel, where unnecessary columns were removed, and data values were spell-checked, translated, and cleaned. Duplicate rows and rows with empty or zero values were eliminated, resulting in over 15,000 rows of clean data.*
